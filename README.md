# spacex-launch-prediction

## Project Overview
This project predicts SpaceX Falcon 9 first stage landing success using machine learning. The analysis helps estimate launch costs, as SpaceX rocket launches are significantly cheaper when the first stage can be reused.

## Data Collection Methods
- SpaceX REST API integration
- Web scraping from Wikipedia
- Dataset includes launch records with details on boosters, payloads, and landing outcomes

## Features
- Launch data analysis
- Interactive visualizations
- Machine learning models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machines
  - Decision Trees
  - K-Nearest Neighbors

## Technical Stack
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Plotly Dash for dashboards
- Folium for geographic visualizations

## Repository Structure
- data/                 # Raw and processed datasets
- notebooks/            # Jupyter notebooks for analysis
- images/               # Visualization outputs
- presentation/         # Project presentation materials


## Key Findings
Launch success rate improved since 2013
Launch site success rates vary significantly
Payload mass correlates with landing success
Model achieved [X]% prediction accuracy
